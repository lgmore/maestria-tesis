Contrast enhancement is used as a preprocessing of other algorithms such as image segmentation, image fusion, among others. Contrast enhancement is of utmost importance, since a low-contrast image would cause these algorithms to present undesired results. The low contrast of the images may be due to several factors, such as poor lighting or faults with the acquisition medium. The problem of low contrast is solved using a technique that enhances the visual quality of the image. Mathematical morphology is one of the techniques that improves images with low contrast, and has demonstrated efficiency in improving the quality of grayscale images. For its application in color images, it is necessary to adopt a color space and to determine an order for the components of the vectors of the color image. Applications of different areas, such as medical sciences, engineering and geosciences, use contrast enhancement in preprocessing stages.

This work presents an algorithm that improves the visual quality of grayscale images and color images. The proposed algorithm extracts image characteristics in multiple scales using mathematical morphology. The validation of the proposal was done using 200 color images from a public database. The size of the color images are $481 \times 321$ and $321 \times 481$. The comparison was performed with algorithms that modify the histogram and another that uses the multiscale top-hat transform. The evaluation of the experimental results was done with metrics that evaluate the local and global contrast. The proposed algorithm obtained better numerical and visual evaluations for all cases tested, both for grayscale images and color images.
